      <h2>Chapter One: The Arrival</h2>
      <p>SoHo buzzed with the rhythm of a waking city. Morning sunlight bounced off brick buildings and painted windows with golden warmth. Cafés flung open their doors, sending the scent of espresso into the air. Artists unrolled canvases onto sidewalks, brushing the day into motion with color and life. Taxi horns sang their impatient tune, and somewhere, a saxophone whispered blues through an open window.</p>
      <p>Then came the light.</p>
      <p>It wasn't a spotlight or a streetlamp flare—no, it was softer, purer. It slipped through the clouds like a breath from heaven, descending gently into a quiet alley tucked between the pulse of it all.</p>
      <p>And from that light, a man stepped out.</p>
      <p>Barefoot, his expression one of awe and uncertainty, Alan looked around. His hands touched the rough brick walls, the damp sidewalk, the buzzing of the world in motion. He was tall, with striking eyes that mirrored the sky, as if they had seen galaxies.</p>
      <p>"So this is Earth…" he whispered. "And this is me… human."</p>
      <p>He stepped onto the sidewalk, swallowed by the city’s current.</p>

      <h2>Chapter Two: Gravity</h2>
      <p>Later that morning, Alan wandered into a narrow gallery tucked behind a florist shop. It was small but alive—paintings filled every inch of the walls, from floor to ceiling. They pulsed with color, emotion, soul. He stopped in front of one—bold strokes of red and violet twisted together like heartbeats.</p>
      <p>A voice, soft and clear, broke the silence behind him.</p>
      <p>"That one’s called Gravity," she said. "Funny name for something about falling… in love."</p>
      <p>Alan turned. She stood with a quiet grace, her eyes warm and steady, her hair cascading in dark waves past her shoulders. Adeline.</p>
      <p>"Do people fall in love here?" he asked, genuinely curious.</p>
      <p>She tilted her head, smiling.</p>
      <p>"Every day," she said. "Sometimes in the most unexpected places."</p>
      <p>He hesitated, then stepped closer.</p>
      <p>"Would you care to show me what those places are?"</p>
      <p>Their eyes met. The world narrowed. Something passed between them—soft and invisible but unmistakably real.</p>

      <h2>Chapter Three: Through the Day</h2>
      <p>Time blurred after that.</p>
      <p>They wandered the cobblestone streets of SoHo as the sun dipped low, turning the sky into a canvas of rose and gold. They shared pastries at a rooftop café, laughing like they'd known each other forever. Music drifted from a nearby alley, where a violinist played a haunting tune that wrapped around them like silk.</p>
      <p>In every moment, Alan found himself watching Adeline. The way her fingers brushed against walls, how her eyes lit up when she spoke about art and dreams and the little joys of life.</p>
      <p>"Why do I feel like I already know you?" she asked, voice barely louder than the evening breeze.</p>
      <p>Alan smiled gently. "I feel the same. Like I was always meant to find you."</p>

      <h2>Chapter Four: Under the Stars</h2>
      <p>The rooftop was quiet.</p>
      <p>Above them, stars spread endlessly across the sky, and below, the city murmured in soft pulses of light. They sat side by side, legs dangling over the ledge, their shoulders brushing as they stared upward.</p>
      <p>Alan broke the silence first. His voice was slow, thoughtful.</p>
      <p>"I was sent here to understand love," he said. "But now I wonder… what if I was sent here for you?"</p>
      <p>Adeline turned to him. Her eyes searched his face—earnest, curious, and filled with something new.</p>
      <p>"Maybe it’s the same thing," she whispered.</p>
      <p>They leaned toward each other at the same time. No rush, no music swells, no sudden flare of drama. Just breath, closeness, and the pause before something beautiful.</p>
      <p>Their lips met—softly, slowly. The kiss was tender, a promise born under starlight. Around them, the world seemed to hush, wrapped in a glow no one else could see.</p>
      <p>And somewhere deep within him, Alan finally understood.</p>
      <p>In a city that never sleeps, he had found the one thing even Heaven had no words for.</p>
      <p><strong>Love.</strong></p>
